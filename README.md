The Food Diary is a desktop app for managing food diary entries, optimized with a Command Line Interface (CLI) 
and packaged with a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

The Food Diary caters to food-passionate NUS students who would ideally benefit from keeping records of food 
options tasted in the vicinity of NUS.
